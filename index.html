        <div class="question">
            Que.1 What are function constructors?
        </div>

        <div class="ans">
            <div class="explaination">
                A constructor is a special function that creates and initializes an object instance of a class. In
                JavaScript, a constructor gets called when an object is created using the new keyword. <br>

                The purpose of a constructor is to create a new object and set values for any existing object
                properties.
            </div>
            <pre>
//Constructor
function User (name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
}
var user1 = new User('yash', 21);
console.log(user1)//user1{name:yash,age=21}
var user2 = new User('bharat', 22);
console.log(user2)//user1{name:bharat,age=22}

        <div class="question">
            Que.2 Explain call(), apply() and, bind() methods. Give an example of call(), apply(), bind()?

        <div class="ans">
            <div class="explaination">
                <h3>Call :</h3> The call method is used to invoked a function with a specific 'this' value, and
                arguments
                provide individuly. <br>
                The call() method invokes a function in which first argument will be the object and rest of the
                arguments required by function will be provided as an individual arguments. <br>
                <h3>Apply : </h3> Apply is similar with call, but take argument as an array. <br>
                The apply() method invokes a function in which first argument will be the object and rest of the
                arguments will be passed as an array of elements. <br>
                <h3>Bind :</h3> Bind is a function that helps you create another function that you can execute later
                with the new context of this that is provided. <br>
                The bind() method returns a new function and this function will be having the reference of the object
                passed, now whenever you want to use this returned function in the code you can use it by passing rest
                of the arguments. <br>

            <h3>Output:</h3>
            yash is 21 years old BGMI is the hobies and frontEnd dev is skill <br>

            Ques.3 What is the purpose of async/await keywords?

            <div class="explaination">
                An async function is a function declared with the async keyword, and the await keyword is permitted
                within it. The async and await keywords enable asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a
                cleaner style, avoiding the need promise chains.

            <pre>
function myPromise(alpha,time){
